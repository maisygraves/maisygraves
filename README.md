### Hi, I’m Maisy Graves <sub>(she/her)</sub>


I believe that well-stewarded data gives people the tools they need to understand the systems around them so they can advocate for themselves.

I aim to empower people through data  by translating complex information into accurate and meaningful stories, providing insights that support 
informed, impactful decisions and bringing complexity and nuance to light. I'm especially interested in bridging disciplines — using data, ethics, 
and clear argumentation to bring complex, fragmented problems into sharper focus. I believe that better thinking comes from better questions, not 
tighter silos.
