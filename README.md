### Hi, I’m Maisy Graves <sub>(she/her)</sub>


I believe that well-stewarded data gives people the tools they need to understand the systems around them so they can advocate for themselves.

I aim to empower people through data  by asking the right questions, translating complex information into accurate and meaningful stories, 
providing insights that support informed, impactful decisions and bringing complexity and nuance to light.

- finishing my M.S. in Data Analytics
- figuring out what my "personal brand" is
